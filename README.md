# Standard Bank Data Science Virtual Internship

This repository contains my work for the **Standard Bank Data Science Virtual Internship** hosted on **Forage**. Through this internship, I developed practical data science skills by working on real-world problems similar to those encountered by Standard Bank's data team.

## Overview

This project covers tasks typically undertaken by a data scientist at Standard Bank, including:

- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Insights generation and business decision-making  
- Communicating findings to stakeholders  

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this internship, I have gained experience in:

- Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Implementing machine learning models  
- Interpreting model results for business insights  
- Presenting data-driven recommendations  

## Project Tasks

1. **Understanding the Dataset**  
   - Explored and cleaned the dataset  
   - Identified missing values and outliers  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualised key trends and patterns  
   - Generated summary statistics  

3. **Building a Predictive Model**  
   - Implemented a machine learning model to solve a business problem  
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics  

4. **Communicating Insights**  
   - Translated findings into actionable business insights  
   - Prepared a summary report and presentation  

## Skills Utilised

This project required proficiency in:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- Data visualisation and storytelling  
- Machine learning fundamentals  
- Business analytics concepts  

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any preferred IDE)  
- **Data Science Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
